Oppositional Thinking Analysis: Classifying Critical vs. Conspiratorial Narratives about Covid-19

This project focuses on oppositional thinking analysis through text classification. Using a dataset of 4,000 email instances, the goal was to distinguish critical discourse from conspiratorial narratives. Key tasks included extracting data insights, selecting appropriate pre-processing techniques, and applying Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models for text classification. Additionally, semantic textual similarity was computed to enhance understanding of discourse patterns. The results highlight the effectiveness of these methods in classifying and analyzing narratives, providing valuable insights into misinformation detection and the distinction between critical and conspiratorial content.

Key Highlights:

Models / Neural Network Architecture Constructed: Naïve Bayes, Feedforward Neural Network
Tools: PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
